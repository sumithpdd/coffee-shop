While we have talked about what Gatsby is and some of the few similarities between Gatsby and Next, in this section, we will show you a particular area where Gatsby shines — Static websites.

A static website consists of a series of separate HTML pages, each page representing a physical webpage. Remember the old websites that did not have a lot of clickable elements? Those are static websites.

Different users visiting a static website will see the same content, and updates are not visible in real-time. A personal blog is a good example of a static website.

Since the number of pages is predictable and the content doesn’t change, Gatsby is perfect for building these websites. Gatsby offers support from a variety of CMS systems, REST APIs, databases, and GraphQL.

A key difference between Gatsby and Next.JS is the way they handle data. Gatsby separates the data and the website, meaning that members of your team other than developers can also edit data on the web page, which can then be compiled as the site during the runtime.

Connecting to a CMS via a plugin and the ability to update data without programming knowledge means Gatsby is the preferred framework for creating static websites. But things are slowly changing
