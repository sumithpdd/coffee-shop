Both Next.Js and Gatsby.Js are React Frameworks that have been around for quite some time now, and each of them has their own strengths and weaknesses.

## **Similarities between Gatsby.Js and Next.Js**

* **Developer experience:** Both Gatsby and Next come with extensive documentation that helps in developing features over an existing app. You don’t have to learn everything from scratch, and a basic understanding of React is the only prerequisite that both the frameworks have.
* **Powerful websites:** Both Gatsby and Next are used to build high-performance websites with very good Lighthouse scores, if well-built, of course. The websites are SEO friendly since both deliver pre-rendered HTML.
* **Cool Features:** Hot Reloading is a feature that most developers love, and both Gatsby and Next come with Hot Reloading out-of-the-box. The other cool inbuilt features include Code Splitting, Prefetching, Routing, and Caching.
