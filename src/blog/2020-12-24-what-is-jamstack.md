[JAMstack](https://jamstack.wtf/) is a radical new way to approach how one goes about building apps and websites. What is means is that you:

1. Pre-render and Build your site/app as much as you can beforehand
2. Deploy the same on CDNs rather than traditional servers and
3. Call the data needed dynamically through APIs!

JAM stands for 3 of the pillars on which JAMstack is built:

* **Javascript**: The browser programming language that helps provide the interactive bits.
* **APIs**: Reusable APIs that handle all the server-side functions or database actions.
* **Markup**: This is a presentation layer of your website, usually a static site generator.

Since the pages are pre-rendered, there is a considerable reduction in the time it takes to load and navigate between webpages since our requests no longer have to go to and from a database.

Some of the most JAMStack friendly CDNs are **Netlify, CloudFare, and Akamai**. Less complicated development also translates to reduced costs.
